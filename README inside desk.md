# InsideDesk Coding Evaluation

## Introduction

The purpose is to evaluate the applicants ability to perform some of the
required coding duties they will encounter in day to day work with InsideDesk.

The project is to be timecapped at 8 hours and compensation will be made for
the 8 hours.

## Problem

There is a file in this archive "aging-report.txt". This is falsified data that
contains patient claim information for various procedures undertaken and which
insurer was submitted the claim. The file also contains information as to the
amount outstanding owed on the claim.

ESTIMATE    CURRENT 31-60   61-90   > 90    TOTAL

The "ESTIMATE" was the initial estimate of how much will be paid by the insurer
for the particular claim.

The "CURRENT" is how much is outstanding in the 30 days since the submission
date (SENT)
31-60 is how much is owing since 31-60 days the date of submission (SENT)
31-60 is how much is owing since 61-90 days the date of submission (SENT)
> 90 is how much is owning since the date of submission (SENT)
TOTAL is the total amount owning since date of submission (SENT)

## Milestone

InsideDesk would like a program to digest this report into a better
structured format automated basis to be able to determine different metrics
the amounts outstanding with different clients.

After the data has been translated. A standalone webpage should be created that
displays a table of the claims outstanding and a few dashboard cards above
which show the total amount owing on all claims and average amount per claim or
anything else you believe would be valuable information.
